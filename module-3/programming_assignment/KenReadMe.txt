Hey Ken,

I'm sorry I didn't complete this assignment properly, I'm pretty disappointed with myself.
I recognize the things I didn't do properly, as well as why I couldn't.  I took a lot of time
to play with things to understand them more, as well as read/watch a lot of tutorials.  This has been a 
rough week with some life stuff, but I don't need sympathy points or anything, I just want you to 
know that this isn't my potential and I'm working on reaching it.  I appreciate the work you're doing
to teach us.

Stephen
